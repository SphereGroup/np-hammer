# np-hammer
C library for quick solving hard graph problems.
## Idea
The goal of this repository is to provide a C library for solving NPH and NPC graph problems as quickly as possible in terms of constant.
## Architecture
Graphs will be represented as adjecency matrixes.  
Algorithms will be implemented as sets of instructions of VM that will provide fast operations on adjacency matrix's rows.
## Problems
The first stable version will include:
- checking if a graph contains given subgraph
- checking if a graph contains given induced subgraph
## Status
In production. Not for use.  
Can try out available code though and leave some feedback.
